# Ground Water Simulation
 This script takes user input for different parameters and simulates the groundwater movement in Plaxis 3D software. Results are also being saved for later analysis. Just so you know, this is being hard coded and does not have the capabilities to handle errors. The script needs modifications to tackle different inputs regarding the structural composition of the pavement layers.
